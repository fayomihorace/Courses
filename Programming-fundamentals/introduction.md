# Introduction to Programming fundamentals course

Hey, welcome to this course in which you'll learn the fundamentals of programmings.
So that make sense to explain first what programming is.

But before let's set the context.
Today technology is deeply intergrated in our lives. We have phones, laptops, 
connected objects. Technology is there to help us automate repetitive tasks, do
complex computations with almost no error. And more ever with AI there are tools
that can kind of think like humain. Kind of, but it's not the subject of this course.

But all that is possile because, we are able to talk to computers, to give inputs, to give orders
using programming.
So programming is: giving a set of instruction to a machine, wether it's a computer or a cell phone,
or a connected fridge, in order to get a result of just to perform some work.


So basically, a person called the programmer write what we then call a program
using a programming language. And the program is sent to the machine with some
potential data to execute.

Example: When you enter a text into your whatsApp and cliks the send button, behind the scene,
someone has already written a program that will be executed by the machine which might probably be your
cellphone.

Now that you know what programming is, you should also know that,
first there are many porgramming languages.
and second, the machine or the computer understand only one programming language, which is called: `the machine code`.

But, we won't enter in the details right now, you just need to know that machine code is not easy to write so people
has created more easier and convinient programming languages called high level programming languages.

In the next video, we are to talk more machine code and programming languages that exists.


And when the programmer finish written the higth level program, he passes it to something called a `compiler`, that
will do the job of translating that high level program to the machine code. So the program can now be executed by the machine.
We call those programming languages: `Compiled Programming languages`.
Some example of such programming languages are: C, C++, Java.

Now there are other high level programming languages, that instead of waiting the programmer to finish writting the 
program before create the machine code version, they are able to do the translation at the same time the programmer is writting.
So the programmer don't need anymore the wait uni
